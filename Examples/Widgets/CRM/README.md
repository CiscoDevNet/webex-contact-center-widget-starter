This widget is configured for demonstration purposes. For production usage, make edits according to the shape of your customer data for accurate results. 

The `./customer-data/mock-customer` file represents a demo customer info object that is imported directly into the widget.

As it currently exists, no additional API keys are needed to demonstrate this widget.
