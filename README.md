# Webex Contact Center Widget Starter
This repository is designed to speed up the initial set up for Agent and or Supervisor Desktop widget development. Feel free to treat this as a boilerplate project, that can be forked as a base foy your Webex Contact Center widget or simply as a reference material. 

We aim at covering various scenarios, for when your development team is leaning towards **React**, or **Angular**, or is willing to explore the pure **Web Component** approach (with some help from *Lit Element* and the *Polymer* project). Dive into the respective folder based on your tech stack preference to get started.
